# Unhandled ZeroDivisionError in Python Function
This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in Python function handling of ZeroDivisionError exception where the code only accounts for the scenario when the denominator is zero, while missing the case of both numerator and denominator being zero.  This can lead to unexpected behavior.

The bug and solution are provided in separate Python files. The solution file provides improved error handling for all possible cases involving zero values.
